In the shadowed ruins of Godric's Hollow, Lily Potter's lifeless form lay still, her final moments marked by bravery. She had been pregnant with a daughter, Mary, when Voldemort attacked. Unbeknownst to anyone, Severus Snape, driven by his love for Lily, saved the unborn child, hiding her from the world and from Voldemort's insidious reach.

But the Dark Lord, always a step ahead, discovered Mary's existence. Instead of killing her, he adopted the infant, seeing potential in raising a Potter child to fight against Harry. Snape, bound by his love for Lily and a desire to protect Mary, joined Voldemort, positioning himself close to the dark wizard to safeguard the girl.

Years passed, and Mary, trained in the dark arts, grew up believing Harry to be her enemy. When the final battle erupted at Hogwarts, she stood against her brother, her eyes cold and determined.

Harry, recognizing something familiar in her, hesitated. "Why are you doing this?" he asked, his voice echoing in the chaos around them.

"You are my enemy," Mary replied, her wand raised, hatred burning in her eyes. "You always have been."

As their duel intensified, Harry's attempts to reach her were futile. They fought fiercely until Harry, with a desperate resolve, shouted, "You don't have to do this! We are family!"

Mary's fury peaked, and she prepared to cast the fatal curse. "Avada Kedavra!" she screamed, her voice shaking with the force of the spell.

In that moment, the spirits of Lily and James Potter emerged, their ethereal forms bathed in a soft glow. They stood between the siblings, their presence halting the curse. "Mary, Harry is your brother," Lily's voice echoed, filled with warmth and sorrow. "Love can save you both."

Stunned, Mary faltered, her mind reeling. As the truth dawned on her, she realized the bond they shared. But it was too late; the spell had been cast. Harry fell, his body crumpling to the ground.

In a surge of panic and grief, Mary seized Harry's wand. The blood tie between them awakened a power within her, and she felt the strength of their connection. Tears streamed down her face as she understood the magnitude of her actions.

Cradling her dying brother, Mary wept. "I'm sorry," she whispered, her voice breaking. "I didn't know."

Harry, with his last breath, smiled faintly. "Love... always."

The spirits of their parents enveloped them in a gentle embrace, and in that moment, the darkness within Mary began to fade, replaced by the enduring light of love.
